## Decision Table: E-commerce Product Filter

This table outlines the expected behavior of the product filter system based on various combinations of user inputs for Brand, Price Range, and Storage.

| Rule | Brand         | Price Range      | Storage (GB) | Expected Action (Filtered Products)                                  |

## 4. Defect Log & GitHub Issues

### Linked GitHub Issues

- [#1: Filter class-boundary issue](https://github.com/PLP-Database-Design/week-4-christianmachira/issues/1) 
- [#2: Title displaying incorrectly](https://github.com/PLP-Database-Design/week-4-christianmachira/issues/2) 

### Bug Report 1

**Title**: Filter class-boundary issue

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Select price range "1000-1500"
2. Click "Apply Filters"

**Expected**: Should display iPhone 14 Pro ($1499)  
**Actual**: No products displayed  
**Severity**: Medium

---

### Bug Report 2

**Title**: title displaying incorrectly

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. launch the app
2. Highlight the title

**Expected**: Should display "ðŸ“± SmartPhone Hub"
**Actual**: SmartPhone Hub
**Severity**: Low

## 5. Reflection

**Challenges Faced:**  
- Making sure the test covered all aspects of the code
- Configuration of tests gave me a bit of a problem since i had to reconfigure the file structure a bit

**Collaboration Benefits:**  
- Group discussions helped plan how to split the work and communicate efficiently
- Sharing our test cases and discussing our outcomes really helped

**Most Effective Techniques:**  
- the storage input boundary value analysis test was most useful since it covered a large scope
- decision table testing was also useful in helping us to know what to expect
